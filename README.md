# Dnote Server

Backend server to sync notes from [dnote-cli](https://github.com/dnote-io/cli)

# Why?

I have started this to understand what is happening when we sync the notes with a backend server, which is at the moment provided as a paid option by the developer. I am not sure if the developer would be releasing the source for the backend server to self-host. Until then this is the option I'll be going with.
